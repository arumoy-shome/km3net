I would like to thank Dr. Adam Belloum and Dr. Ben van Werkhoven for
introducing me to the fascinating field of neutrino detection and
giving me the opportunity to be a part of the KM3NeT research
initiative in collaboration with Nikhef and The Netherlands eScience
Center. I would like to especially thank Dr. Belloum for his guidance
and support throughout the project. Many thanks to Dr. Roel Aaij, Dr.
Ronald Bruijn and Brian O Fearraigh for their technical support on the
physics side of things. Finally my gratitude and best wishes to my
colleague Shruti Rao who is also defending her thesis in the coming
months.
