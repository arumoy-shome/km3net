\chapter{Related Work}

This research project is based directly upon the GPU pipeline proposed
in the seminal work presented by \citeauthor{karas2019data}
(henceforth referred to as the \textit{Karas Pipeline}). Thus,
The Karas pipeline is presented in detail followed by work done by
other authors.

\section{The Karas Pipeline}
\label{sec:karas-pipeline}

The first step of The Karas pipeline is the Hit Correlation step. In
this step, pairs of hits (from events and noise) are considered and
the correlation along two axes namely space and time are considered.
Karas proposes \textit{The Pattern Matrix Criterion}, a novel event
trigger algorithm by creating a correlation criterion based on the
probability that a given space and time difference occurs between two
event hits. From domain knowledge, the evaluation is limited to 100m
and 300ns for space and time differences respectively. The algorithm
is evaluated with a dataset containing 130 event hits and 5000 noise
hits and scores in the range of 0.3 - 0.375 is reported for the
recall, precision and F1 metrics.
